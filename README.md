My submission to project 6/8, as part of Devchallenge's learning path 'Responsive Web Developer'. The project features a fictious, responsive checkout page dealing with forms and inputs.
The challenge was to create a checkout page follwoing the provided Figma design.

User stories:

-   I can see a page following the given design
-   I can input email, phone, full name, address, city, country, and postal code
-   I can input the number of items
-   When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a warning if validation fails
-   When I click submit button or press enter, I can see a successful alert if validation succeeds.

## Features

### Issues to Solve

-   Change the number input(when increasing or decreasing the number of items), to a real input number-type.
-   Solve how to style the number input to look like the design
-   I would like to increase the total price based on the number of items
-   I would like to add tooltips with hint to the input field if user has provided the wrong input
-   I would like to display a custom error message
-   I would like to display a loading animation on the button when the submit button is clicked
-   I would like to display a success message if all of the input were successfully submited
